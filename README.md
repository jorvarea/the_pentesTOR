`the_pentesTOR` is an automation tool designed to facilitate the various stages of penetration testing while leveraging the anonymization capabilities of Tor.

## 🔥 Features

- **Tor Integration**: Anonymize your scans by routing through the Tor network.
- **IP Intelligence**: Fetch your public IP and determine the Tor exit node location.
- **OSINT Gathering**: Gain preliminary intelligence on your target.
- **Comprehensive Scans**: Utilize a range of `nmap` scans for a comprehensive assessment.
- **Directory Brute-Force**: Utilize `gobuster` to discover hidden directories.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure `nmap`, `gobuster`, `whois`, `proxychains`, and `curl` are installed on your system.
- Make sure you have the necessary wordlists available.
- Grant execute permission to the scripts: `chmod +x scriptname.sh`.

### Usage

1. Run the main script with superuser permissions:
```bash
sudo ./main.sh
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Always seek explicit permission before testing or exploiting any system. Unauthorized penetration testing is not only unethical, but also illegal.
